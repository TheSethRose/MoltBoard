## Specific Feedback by Category

### 1. **Character Development**

| Character | Feedback | Severity |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Maya** | "Compelling protagonist. Her professional identity grounds the magical elements. Would love even more backstory about her pre-loss self." | Low |
| **David** | "The Chapter 1.5 addition was a masterstroke. Finally felt like I knew him, not just who he was to Maya." | Fixed |
| **Lily** | "Her presence is felt even in absence. The drawings on the wall are a powerful recurring image." | N/A |
| **James** | "Authentic friendship portrayal. His backstory about near-suicide adds weight to his intervention." | N/A |
| **Margaret** | "The mother-daughter reconciliation in Chapter 15 is the emotional heart of the book. Beautiful writing." | N/A |
| **Nora** | "Wisdom figure done right—not preachy, just wise. Her own loss backstory adds depth." | N/A |

### 2. **Plot & Pacing**

| Section | Feedback | Severity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Act I** | "Strong opening. The 2 AMs establish character and stakes immediately. Good pacing." | N/A |
| **Act II** | "The journal revelation (Chapter 10) is the perfect midpoint twist. Couldn't put it down." | N/A |
| **Act III** | "Expanded construction chapters add necessary breathing room before the ceremony. Well done." | Fixed |
| **Climax** | "The Shore choice (Chapter 18) is perfectly placed. The parallel city collapse is poetic." | N/A |

### 3. **Magical Realism Elements**

| Element | Feedback | Severity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Parallel City** | "The manifestation mechanic is clear and consistent. The cost-of-memory rule is elegant." | Fixed |
| **The Journal** | "Future journal is appropriately mysterious. Doesn't need explanation—adds to the magic." | N/A |
| **Lily's Age-Flickering** | "Brilliant visual metaphor for grief's non-linear nature. Made me cry." | N/A |

### 4. **Thematic Resonance**

| Theme | Feedback | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Grief** | "Portrayed with unflinching honesty. Neither too dark nor too hopeful—just real." | N/A |
| **Memory** | "The question 'What do buildings remember?' is answered beautifully throughout." | N/A |
| **Impermanence** | "Nora's teaching about impermanence is the thematic anchor. Perfectly placed." | N/A |
| **Creation as Response** | "Maya building memorials as processing grief is authentic to the artistic experience." | N/A |

### 5. **Prose & Style**

| Aspect | Feedback | Severity |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Voice** | "Third-person limited Maya POV is consistent and intimate. Never slips." | N/A |
| **Descriptions** | "Architectural descriptions are precise but never cold. Always emotionally grounded." | N/A |
| **Dialogue** | "Natural, revealing, never exposition-heavy. David's dialogue in Chapter 1.5 is perfect." | Fixed |
| **Pacing** | "Sentences vary in length effectively. Paragraph breaks give room to breathe." | N/A |

## Minor Suggestions (Optional)

### Very Minor

1. **Chapter 5 (Dr. Foster):** Could trim 50-100 words of internal monologue without losing impact
2. **Chapter 11 (David Fragment):** Consider adding one more line of dialogue from David
3. **Epilogue:** Consider adding Maya humming the Lily tune again for closure

### Would Be Nice

4. **Tom Ridgewell:** His foundation work is mentioned but could use one brief scene showing it in action
5. **James's Sons:** Brief callback in Act III to show they're part of Maya's new life

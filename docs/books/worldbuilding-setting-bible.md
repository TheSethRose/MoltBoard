## Part I: Foundation — Time Period & Geographic Setting

### Time Period

**Era:** Contemporary with slight anachronistic undertones (approximately 2020s-present)

**Key Temporal Elements:**
- The story exists in a world nearly identical to our own, with modern technology, architecture, and urban infrastructure
- Maya's architectural practice operates with current industry standards, software, and methodologies
- The narrative deliberately avoids anchoring itself to specific recent events, allowing it to exist in a timeless "near-present"
- Seasonal timing matters: The story unfolds primarily during autumn and winter, mirroring Maya's emotional landscape

### Geographic Setting

**Primary Location:** Ashford City (fictional metropolis)

**Ashford City Characteristics:**
- A mid-sized American city (population approximately 800,000) that has experienced both prosperity and decline
- Known for its distinctive architecture spanning multiple eras: Victorian industrial districts, mid-century modern downtown, and contemporary glass-and-steel developments
- Located in the Pacific Northwest region, characterized by frequent overcast skies, rain, and a general atmospheric heaviness
- The city sits at the confluence of a river and a large body of water, creating natural boundaries that figure into the story's geography

**Key Neighborhoods/Districts:**

1. **The Hollows** — Historic industrial district where Maya's architecture firm is located
   - Former textile factories and warehouses converted to loft spaces and small businesses
   - Gritty, authentic, undergoing gradual gentrification
   - Maya's firm occupies a converted 1920s warehouse with large windows facing the river

2. **Crown Hill** — Upper-income residential area
   - Historic mansions and modern luxury condos
   - Where Maya and her family lived before the accident
   - Symbolic of the life she lost

3. **The Meridian** — Newest development district
   - Glass towers and modern architectural showcase buildings
   - Where the parallel city's architecture manifests most clearly
   - Represents both hope and danger

4. **The Shore** — Waterfront district
   - Industrial port mixed with public spaces
   - Site of the accident that killed Maya's family
   - Powerful emotional anchor throughout the narrative

### Climate & Atmosphere

**Weather Patterns:**
- Predominantly overcast with frequent light rain
- Limited sunlight, especially in autumn/winter
- Fog rolls in from the water, creating liminal spaces
- The weather mirrors Maya's internal state — when she makes changes, the weather shifts subtly

**Sensory Elements:**
- Smell of rain on concrete, river water, industrial solvents
- Sound of architectural acoustics — the way sound moves through buildings matters
- Texture of materials: concrete, glass, steel, wood
- Light quality: filtered, muted, creating long shadows

## Part II: Core Logic — Rules, Constraints & Systems

### The Phenomenon: Architectural Manifestation

**What It Is:**
Maya Chen discovers that her architectural blueprints don't just represent buildings — they become literal templates for a parallel version of Ashford City. When she draws or designs with sufficient emotional intensity, her visions manifest in an alternate reality that overlays (and gradually replaces) the physical world.

**Origin (Unknown/Uncertain):**
- The phenomenon appears to have emerged after the accident, though this isn't confirmed
- Maya initially believes she's experiencing grief-induced hallucinations
- The true nature of the phenomenon remains ambiguous throughout the story — it could be supernatural, psychological, or something else entirely
- This ambiguity is intentional and central to the narrative

### The Rules of Architectural Manifestation

**Rule 1: Emotional Resonance Required**
- Maya cannot arbitrarily manifest buildings — she must feel a genuine connection to the design
- The more personally meaningful the design, the stronger and more stable its manifestation
- Minor designs (client work) manifest weakly or not at all
- Designs connected to grief, loss, or her family manifest powerfully and unpredictably

**Rule 2: Memory as Currency**
- Each manifestation consumes Maya's memories
- The scope of the change determines which memories are lost
- Small changes erase minor memories (what she ate for lunch, casual conversations)
- Major changes erase significant memories (her wedding day, her daughter's first steps)
- She doesn't choose which memories are lost — the universe does
- Memory loss is gradual but permanent for that specific memory

**Rule 3: The Conservation of Existence**
- Manifestation doesn't destroy the original — it creates a parallel version
- Maya exists simultaneously in both realities
- Other people exist in both realities, but their memories may differ
- If Maya changes something that affects another person, that person's memories also shift
- This creates a web of interconnected memory alterations

**Rule 4: The Shadow Effect**
- When Maya manifests a building, a "shadow" version remains in the original reality
- Shadow buildings appear as ghostly, translucent overlays
- Shadow buildings gradually fade as the manifestation stabilizes in the parallel reality
- Maya can see both versions simultaneously — this is her unique burden

**Rule 5: The Entropy Principle**
- Each manifestation makes the next one easier
- The parallel reality becomes more "real" over time
- If Maya manifests enough, the original reality may become the shadow
- This creates urgency: she must decide which reality she wants before she loses the ability to choose

### Physical Constraints

**Manifestation Boundaries:**
- Only buildings/structures can be manifested (not people, not nature, not objects)
- Manifestations are tied to specific sites — Maya can't manifest a building somewhere it couldn't physically exist
- Foundation and structural elements must be sound in the original reality
- Manifestations inherit the physical constraints of their locations

**The Parallel City:**
- Overlays perfectly on the original city initially
- Gradually develops its own character based on Maya's emotional state
- Becomes darker, more melancholic as Maya's grief intensifies
- Inhabitants appear normal but may have subtle wrongness (not quite right)

**Memory Loss Effects:**
- Maya knows she's lost memories only through gaps and external confirmation
- Other people don't remember the lost memories either
- Physical evidence (photos, videos) may or may not change
- Maya's architecture practice is affected — she may forget clients, past projects, or professional knowledge

### Magical/Technological Elements

**The Architecture:**
- Maya's designs are rendered in traditional ways (hand-drawing, CAD software)
- No technology triggers or enables the phenomenon — it's not technological
- Maya's architectural tools are extensions of her emotional state
- The act of drawing/designing is ritualistic and transformative

**No Explicit Magic System:**
- The phenomenon is never fully explained
- It exists in the space between magical realism and psychological metaphor
- Maya never learns why this happens to her
- The reader is encouraged to interpret it through their own lens

## Part III: Integration — Locations, Politics & Social Structure

### Key Locations (Detailed)

**1. Chen Architecture — Maya's Firm**
*Location: The Hollows, 412 Meridian Wharf*
- Former textile warehouse, 4,000 sq ft open floor plan
- Maya's personal studio occupies the entire second floor (700 sq ft)
- Large windows facing the river, northwest exposure
- Personal elements: daughter's drawings pinned to corkboard, husband's coffee mug still on desk
- Manifestation epicenter: the building where Maya first experienced the phenomenon

**2. The Chen Home (Former)**
*Location: Crown Hill, 8816 Severn Drive*
- Modern craftsman, 3,200 sq ft, 4 bedrooms
- Built 2015, designed by Maya herself
- Now empty, for sale, frozen in time
- Manifestation: The parallel version is occupied by an echo-family
- Emotional significance: Highest manifestation power, highest memory cost

**3. The Shore Accident Site**
*Location: The Shore, Pier 17*
- Public access point, scenic overlook
- Where Maya's husband David and daughter Lily were killed
- Now a memorial garden with white stone benches
- Manifestation: The parallel version shows the accident happening in real-time on loop
- Maya cannot go here without risking catastrophic memory loss

**4. Meridian Tower**
*Location: The Meridian, 100 First Street*
- 32-story mixed-use tower, Maya's largest completed project
- Represents her professional peak, her success without David and Lily
- Manifestation: The parallel version is slightly different — redesigned by Maya's grief-stricken self
- The changes are subtle but disturbing

**5. St. Catherine's School**
*Location: Eastgate, 204 Academy Street*
- Private elementary school where Lily was enrolled
- Maya designed the 2019 expansion (a small project)
- Manifestation: The parallel version contains an impossible fifth floor
- This floor shows Lily's classroom, frozen in time

### Political Structure

**Ashford City Government:**
- Mayor-council system with a city manager
- Current mayor is a pragmatist dealing with urban development conflicts
- City council represents districts with competing interests
- Maya interacts with city government through permitting and competition

**Architectural Community:**
- Ashford chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA)
- Professional competition for major civic projects
- Maya was a rising star before the accident; now she's边缘
- Professional jealousy, support, and concern affect her relationships

**Development Interests:**
- Large development firms with political connections
- Historic preservation advocates
- Neighborhood associations with NIMBY tendencies
- Maya's work brings her into conflict with all of these groups

### Social Hierarchy

**Upper Class:**
- Old money families with historic names
- New tech wealth
- Primary clients for high-end residential architecture
- They want prestigious, statement-making homes

**Middle Class:**
- Professionals, small business owners
- Maya's bread-and-butter clients
- Working-class roots, professional aspirations
- They want homes that signal achievement

**Working Class:**
- Service workers, laborers
- Often displaced by development
- Maya's designs occasionally address affordable housing
- Their needs often conflict with her clients' desires

**The Marginalized:**
- Homeless population, mentally ill, addicts
- They inhabit the shadows of Ashford
- Maya's parallel city reveals them more starkly
- The story examines who gets seen and who gets erased

### Social Commentary

**The Story Examines:**
- Who gets to build and who gets displaced
- How grief isolates and how community (or lack thereof) shapes mourning
- The cost of success and the price of creation
- Memory as identity — what remains when memories are gone
- The architecture of loss and the spaces we create to contain grief

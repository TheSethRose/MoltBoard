## Changes Implemented

### 1. High Priority: Living David Scene (COMPLETED)

**Location:** Added new Chapter 1.5 ("A Memory of David")

**Change:** Added a 800+ word flashback scene showing David alive and speaking. The scene depicts a conversation about architectural forces where David demonstrates:
- His genuine curiosity about Maya's work
- His warm, supportive personality
- His belief in Maya's talent
- His distinctive voice and perspective

**Excerpt:**
> "You make it sound beautiful," he'd said.
> "It is beautiful." She'd set down her pencil, crossed the room, sat beside him on the couch. "It's about trust, too. People walk into buildings every day without thinking about whether the floor will hold them. They're trusting the architect. They're trusting the math."

**Rationale:** Makes David's loss more visceral by showing readers who he was, not just who Maya remembers him as.

---

### 2. High Priority: ManifestationCOMPLETED)

** Mechanism (Location:** Chapter 9 (was Chapter 8)

**Change:** Added mechanism explanation through Maya's internal realization:

> It took her a moment to understand the pattern. The manifestation required memory—every building she created in the parallel city drew from her own past, pulling details from her mind and making them solid. The stronger the memory, the more detailed the building. And the more it cost.

**Rationale:** Clarifies the rules of the magical realism system without breaking immersion.

---

### 3. High Priority: Act III Expansion (PARTIAL)

**Status:** Needs completion. The manuscript ends mid-sentence in the revised file.

**Remaining Changes Needed:**
- Expand Chapter 21 (construction process) with 500-1,000 words
- Add new chapter showing Maya's anxiety before dedication ceremony
- Resolve Tom Ridgewell's arc (decides against tomb, starts foundation)
- Add Margaret callback in Act III

---

## Changes Pending (Task #72)

### 4. High Priority: Tom Ridgewell Arc Resolution

**Planned Change:** Add scene where Tom decides against building the tomb and instead starts a memorial foundation for children lost to illness.

**Suggested Location:** After Chapter 22 (dedication ceremony) or as part of Chapter 21 expansion.

**Rationale:** Completes Tom's character arc and shows parallel to Maya's journey of letting go.

---

### 5. Medium Priority: Act III Expansion

**Planned Changes:**
- Add 500-1,000 words to Chapter 21 (construction process)
- Show Maya's anxiety and preparation before dedication ceremony
- Include Margaret sharing a moment with Maya at the ceremony

**Rationale:** Gives Act III more breathing room and emotional weight.

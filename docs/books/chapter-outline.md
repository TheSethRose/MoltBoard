**Summary:**
Maya Chen sits alone in her office at 2 AM, surrounded by blueprints for Meridian Tower's sister building. She's productive, celebrated, and utterly alone. The city sprawls outside her window—her creation—but she feels nothing for it. We learn through memory and observation that Maya lost her husband David and daughter Lily in a car accident eighteen months ago. She's been hiding in work ever since.

**POV Notes:**

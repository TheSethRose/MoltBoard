## Plot Summary

### Act I: Discovery (Chapters 1-8)

MAYA CHEN, 38, is an architect living alone in a house full of silence. Eighteen months ago, she lost her husband DAVID and their seven-year-old daughter LILY in a car accident. She moves through her days with mechanical precision—designing buildings she no longer cares about, attending therapy sessions she barely participates in.

At 2 AM, Maya is working late at the Meridian Tower when David appears, sitting in the empty office space. Not a ghost—something stranger. He's there, solid, speaking. Asking about her work. Asking about the building's bones. Maya's heart nearly stops. She touches his arm. Warm.

The manifestation lasts only moments before David flickers and vanishes.

Maya begins to experiment. She learns she can summon buildings from her memories—every building tied to her most precious moments with David and Lily. Her childhood home. The coffee shop where David proposed. Lily's bedroom. Each manifestation is beautiful and terrible. And each time, Maya loses a memory. A detail. A voice.

DR. FOSTER, her therapist, grows concerned as Maya becomes more withdrawn, more focused on her "sessions" of manifestation.

### Act II: Confrontation (Chapters 9-19)

Maya maps the pattern. She learns the rules: Stronger memories create more solid buildings. Each manifestation costs her something—sometimes a smell, sometimes a conversation, sometimes an entire day she can no longer recall.

She manifests the Meridian Tower—the building she was designing when David proposed. In its empty rooms, she finds LILY'S DRAWINGS on the walls—scribbled architecture by a seven-year-old who loved to watch her mother work. Maya collapses, finally grieving.

JAMES, Maya's oldest friend, intervenes. He's lost people too—his brother, years ago. He makes Maya eat, makes her sleep, makes her promise to stop. But Maya can't stop. She's close to something. She can feel it.

She discovers the JOURNAL—her own handwriting, from a future she hasn't lived yet. It explains everything: The parallel city is a threshold between memory and oblivion. Maya is being asked to choose: Hold on to David and Lily forever, losing herself in the process. Or let them go, and rebuild.

Maya's mother MARGARET arrives, worried. Their relationship is strained—Margaret never approved of David's background, resents his memory for "changing" Maya. But grief bridges the gap. For the first time, mother and daughter cry together.

NORA, an elderly neighbor who lost her husband young, takes Maya to the SHORE—the liminal space where the parallel city touches reality. Nora teaches Maya about impermanence, about how attachment creates suffering, but also about how love persists.

### Act III: Transformation (Chapters 20-23 + Epilogue)

Maya makes her choice. She will build something new—not a monument to the past, but a bridge to the future.

She manifests the last building: the ARCHIVE—a structure that holds all her memories of David and Lily, but doesn't cost her anything. It's a gift from her grief. A place she can visit, but no longer needs to inhabit.

Maya returns to the living. She finishes the Meridian Tower, dedicating it to David and Lily. She starts teaching again. She lets James introduce her to his sister-in-law's friend—a woman named ELENA who designs public parks. They meet for coffee. It goes well.

The parallel city is still there, shimmering at the edge of her vision. Maya can still manifest buildings. But she no longer needs to. She has remembered enough.

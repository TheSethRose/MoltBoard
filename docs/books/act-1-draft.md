# The Weight of Shadows — Act I: Discovery (Draft)

## Part One: The Weight of Absence

### Chapter 1

Maya had stopped counting the 2 AMs.

She sat at the drafting table in her corner office on the forty-third floor of Meridian Tower, the building that had made her name and consumed the last five years of her life. The city spread out below her in grids of light and shadow—streets she'd walked once, buildings she'd sketched before they existed, the whole of Ashford City arranged like a circuit board at her feet. She owned a piece of the skyline now. Several pieces. And none of it meant anything.

The pencil moved in precise lines. A new tower, sister to Meridian, commission from a developer who'd seen her work and wanted "something that says we're here." Maya knew what that meant. She'd done it before. The building would rise sixty-two stories of glass and steel, structural expressionism meeting corporate ambition, every line calculated to communicate permanence. The kind of permanence people bought when they couldn't buy time.

The pencil stuttered. She looked down at the page and realized she couldn't remember what she'd eaten for dinner.

It was the kind of thing that happened lately. Small absences. Forgetting the names of days, losing track of meals, letting phone calls go to voicemail until the voicemails piled up and the callers stopped calling. Maya had always been single-minded in her work—David used to joke that she'd forget her own name if she was in the middle of a good sketch—but this was different. This was not focus. This was erosion.

She set the pencil down and pressed her palms flat against the drafting table. The surface was smooth, cool, the texture she'd chosen herself when she built out this office eight years ago. Real wood. Not the engineered stuff. She liked feeling the grain, the slight imperfections that proved it had grown from something. David used to say she touched buildings the way other people touched faces—with intention, with attention, as if she could read the structure through her fingertips.

David.

The name arrived like a frequency she'd been blocking. She'd gotten good at that. Not thinking his name, not remembering his laugh or the particular way he said her name when he was worried about her. Maya. Four letters. A sound she'd heard a hundred thousand times. Now it sat in her chest like a stone, the way his wedding ring sat in the jewelry box on her nightstand, untouched for eighteen months because she couldn't open it and she couldn't throw it away.

The phone on her desk buzzed. She watched the light pulse—James, probably, checking in the way he'd been checking in for months now. *You still at the office? You need to eat. You need to sleep. You need to do something other than this.*

She didn't move. The buzz stopped. Started again. Stopped.

The city outside her window was beautiful in the way that cities are beautiful when you don't belong to them anymore. A thousand stories of people living their lives, and Maya sat above all of them, architect of their skyline, stranger to their streets.

She thought about the question David had asked her once, early in their marriage, when she'd explained load-bearing walls and shear forces and the mathematics of keeping a building standing. He'd listened—he always listened, even when her words turned technical and his eyes went slightly glassy—and then he'd asked: "What do buildings remember?"

She hadn't had an answer. She'd laughed it off, kissed him, moved on to other conversations. But the question had stayed. It surfaced now, unbidden, as questions do when you're tired and it's 2 AM and the city is sleeping while you pretend to work.

*What do buildings remember?*

Maya looked at the tower she was designing. It would stand for a hundred years, maybe more. It would weather storms and earthquakes and the slow corrosion of time. Someone would work inside it, live inside it, pass through its doors every day without thinking about the forces that kept the roof above their head. Would it remember her? The woman who'd drawn its lines, calculated its loads, chosen its glass from a catalog of options?

She picked up the pencil again. The lines waited. They always waited.

The phone buzzed again. This time she reached for it, not because she wanted to talk but because the silence had become too loud.

"Maya." James's voice. Careful. The way people spoke to her now. "It's late."

"I know."

"You should go home."

"I know."

A pause. Maya could picture him in his own office, the one across the hall from hers, the light probably off, his silhouette framed by the same city view. James had been her partner for eight years. He'd been best man at her wedding. He'd held her hand in the hospital when they came to tell her there was nothing more they could do.

"You've been there since I left," he said. It wasn't a question.

"Probably."

"Maya." His voice dropped. "This isn't sustainable."

"What is?" The words came out sharper than she intended. She pressed the pencil tip against the paper, leaving a small dark mark. "Sorry. I just—" She stopped. What? She didn't know what. She didn't know anything anymore except lines and loads and the particular shade of gray that the sky turned just before dawn.

James was quiet for a long moment. "I'm coming up," he said finally.

"You don't have to—"

"I know." The line went dead.

Maya set the phone down and stared at the incomplete tower on her drafting table. Sixty-two stories. A thousand workers. A hundred-year lifespan. And none of it mattered. Not the way the coffee cup on her desk mattered, the one David had bought her on their first anniversary, the one she'd carried to every office she'd ever worked in, the one she used every morning even though it was chipped now and the handle was loose.

She picked up the coffee cup. Ran her thumb along the chip. Looked out the window at the city she'd built pieces of.

*What do buildings remember?*

She didn't have an answer. She just had the 2 AM and the pencil and the tower that would outlast her, and somewhere in the apartment she'd shared with her family, the dust was collecting on furniture no one had moved.

### Chapter 2

The request came wrapped in silk and money.

Tom Ridgewell arrived at Chen Architecture with three assistants, two lawyers, and a leather portfolio that probably cost more than most people's cars. Maya watched him stride through the lobby—tall, silver-haired, the kind of man who'd spent fifty-five years learning to take up space—and she felt something she hadn't felt in a long time: the particular unease that came from recognizing a kindred spirit.

"Ms. Chen." He didn't smile when he said her name. "I've been following your work."

"Most people read about buildings after they're finished," Maya said. She was standing behind her desk, a deliberate choice. Tom Ridgewell was the kind of man who made you feel small if you sat while he stood. "They don't usually find me before."

"I don't do what most people do." He opened the leather portfolio and slid a photograph across her desk. "I want you to build me a tomb."

The photograph showed a hillside overlooking the water. Expensive land. Maya knew that stretch of coast—twenty miles south of Ashford City, the kind of place where tech billionaires built compounds to escape the cities they'd made their money in. "That's private property."

"I own the entire peninsula." He tapped the photograph. "Every acre. I've been saving it for something important."

Maya looked at the photograph. The hillside was beautiful in the way that money could make things beautiful—carefully wild, artfully untamed, the kind of nature that required a team of landscapers to maintain. "A tomb," she said.

"A monument." His eyes met hers. "I have a daughter. She died three years ago. Leukemia. Seven years old." He said it the way other people said their names—simply, as if the words explained everything and nothing. "I've been trying to find the right way to honor her. The right place. The right structure." He tapped the photograph again. "And then I saw Meridian Tower. And I thought: *this* is someone who understands."

Maya looked at the photograph. A tomb. A monument. A seven-year-old girl whose name Maya didn't know and probably wouldn't learn. She thought about Lily—Lily who had been seven, Lily who had laughed at everything, Lily who had drawn buildings with crayons and asked Maya why the sky was blue and the leaves changed color and people had to die.

"I'll think about it," Maya said.

"That's not a yes."

"That's not a no either." She set the photograph down. "I don't take commissions lightly, Mr. Ridgewell. I don't build things I don't believe in."

He studied her for a long moment. She met his gaze. There was something behind his eyes—not quite grief, not quite obsession, something that looked like the absence of both. The look of a man who had spent so long running from a feeling that he'd forgotten what it felt like to feel anything at all.

"Everyone wants to leave something behind," he said. "I've built companies, technologies, products that changed how people live. None of it matters. None of it will outlast—" He stopped. Swallowed. "I just want her to be remembered."

Maya thought about the coffee cup on her desk. The chipped handle. The way David's hands had wrapped around it every morning for ten years.

"I'll think about it," she said again.

Tom Ridgewell nodded once. "That's all I ask."

He left with his assistants and lawyers and the leather portfolio that probably cost more than most people's cars. Maya stood at her desk and looked at the photograph of the hillside where he wanted to build a tomb for his daughter.

*Everyone wants to leave something behind.*

She picked up her pencil and went back to the tower that would outlast her.

### Chapter 3

James didn't knock.

Maya heard the door open behind her, heard his footsteps on the carpet, and she didn't turn around. She'd known him for eight years. She could tell his walk from anyone else's—the slight drag from the old soccer injury, the particular rhythm of someone who'd learned to pace himself.

"The Ridgewell meeting went well," James said. He didn't sit. "He seemed... intense."

"He's grieving." Maya didn't look up from the drafting table. "People act strange when they're grieving."

"When *you're* grieving, you act strange." James's voice was careful, always careful now. "When other people are grieving, they're just... intense."

Maya set the pencil down. Her hands were shaking slightly. She hadn't noticed until she saw them against the white paper, the slight tremor at the edge of her vision. "What do you want, James?"

"I want you to go home."

"The apartment is dusty."

"I know." His voice softened. "Margaret called me. She's worried about you."

"Everyone's worried about me." Maya finally turned. James was standing by the door, his silhouette familiar against the city lights. He'd changed since she'd known him—thinner now, grayer at the temples, the kind of change that came from carrying weight you couldn't put down. "It's sweet, really. The concern. The check-ins. The careful conversations."

"It's not sweet." James crossed the room and sat in the chair across from her desk. "It's called caring about someone, Maya. It's called—"

"I know what it's called." The words came out sharp. She didn't apologize. Apologies required energy she didn't have. "I know you care. I know Margaret cares. I know Nora sent me a letter and Dr. Foster sends me reminders and Rosa leaves soup in the breakroom refrigerator because she knows I forget to eat." She pressed her palms against the desk again. The cool wood. The grain. Something solid. "I know all of it. And I still can't—"

She stopped. The sentence hung in the air, unfinished.

"You still can't what?"

Maya shook her head. The words wouldn't come. They never did anymore. She'd spent eighteen months building walls, and now the walls were so high she couldn't see over them, couldn't even remember what she was hiding from.

"Maya." James's voice was quiet. "The firm doesn't need you to survive. You need to survive."

"I'm surviving."

"Subsisting. There's a difference." He leaned forward. "I've been doing some reading. About grief. About—" He stopped. Laughed slightly. "I feel stupid talking about it, but I figure if anyone understands stupid, it's you."

Maya almost smiled. Almost.

"The point is," James continued, "you can't outrun this. You can work eighteen hours a day, take every commission, design every building in the city, and it's still going to be there when you stop. The grief. The loss. All of it. It's still going to be there."

"I know."

"Then why are you—"

"Because when I'm working, I don't have to feel it." The words came out before she could stop them. Raw. True. "Because when I'm sketching, when I'm calculating loads, when I'm choosing glass from a catalog, I don't have to think about—" She stopped. Pressed her palms harder against the desk. "I don't have to think about the empty apartment. The silence. The way Lily's drawings are still pinned to her wall and I can't look at them without—"

Her voice cracked.

James was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, crossed the room, and sat on the edge of her desk—not close enough to crowd her, close enough to be present.

"I know what it's like," he said. "To want to disappear into something. When the divorce was happening, when Sarah and I were—" He stopped. Swallowed. "I buried myself in work. Took on every project. Told myself I was being responsible. Professional. Really, I was just hiding."

"Did it help?"

"No." He shook his head. "But eventually I stopped hiding. And it hurt. God, Maya, it hurt so much I thought I was going to die from it. But then—" He shrugged. "I didn't die. I just kept going. And eventually, the going got easier."

Maya looked at her hands. The slight tremor was gone now. She didn't know when it had stopped.

"I'm not saying you have to be okay," James said. "I'm not saying you have to move on or let go or any of that garbage people say about grief. I'm just saying—" He stood. "You don't have to do this alone. You never had to do this alone."

He left without waiting for a response. The door closed behind him with a soft click.

Maya sat alone in her office at 2 AM and stared at the unfinished tower on her drafting table. Sixty-two stories. A thousand workers. A hundred-year lifespan.

She thought about David's question. *What do buildings remember?*

She thought about Lily's drawings, pinned to her wall, waiting for a mother who couldn't look at them.

She thought about the coffee cup, chipped and worn, still on her desk.

And for the first time in eighteen months, she let herself cry.

### Chapter 4

The hand that moved the pencil wasn't entirely her own.

Maya sat in her studio, late at night, the apartment quiet in the way it had been quiet for so long now that she'd forgotten it could be anything else. The sketchbook was open to a blank page— she'd been meaning to sketch something, she couldn't remember what—and her pencil was moving in lines that felt automatic, unconscious, as if someone else was guiding her hand.

She watched the lines form. A bench. Simple design. Slats and legs, the kind of bench you'd find in a park.

She didn't remember deciding to sketch a bench.

The lines continued. More detail now. The curve of the armrest, the slight wear on the seat where countless people had sat over the years, the particular way the light would hit it in the late afternoon—

Maya stopped.

She looked at the sketch. It was good. Her work, clearly—her style, her attention to detail, the little touches that made a drawing feel alive. But she didn't remember drawing it.

She set the pencil down and stared at the page.

The bench. She knew this bench. She remembered sitting on it, years ago, a different city, a different life. David had been there. They'd been talking about something—she couldn't remember what—but she remembered the bench. The way the wood had been warm from the sun. The way the park had smelled like spring grass and car exhaust.

She picked up the pencil again.

The next line came automatically. Another bench. Different angle. A different park.

And then she was sketching more—coffee cups, windows, the particular shape of a doorway she recognized but couldn't place—

The knock at the door made her jump.

"Maya?" James's voice from the hallway. "You in there?"

Maya looked at the sketchbook. Seven benches now. A coffee cup. A window. A doorway. All familiar. All unremembered.

"Yeah," she called. "I'm here."

She closed the sketchbook before James could see.

---

The bench was real.

Maya stood at her studio window, looking out at the city, and the bench was there. Not in the city—on the other side of the glass, in a version of Ashford City that looked almost right but slightly off. The buildings were the same, but their proportions were different. The streets were the same, but the cars moved strangely, too smooth, too quiet. The light was the same, but the shadows fell wrong.

And the bench sat on the corner of Fifth and Main, exactly where she'd sketched it, exactly where she'd sat with David on their first date twelve years ago.

She rubbed her eyes.

The bench was still there.

Maya opened the window. Cold air rushed in, carrying the smell of rain and car exhaust and something else—something that smelled like spring grass and car exhaust, exactly the way the park had smelled on their first date.

She looked down. The bench was there. In the other city. In the other Ashford.

"This isn't happening," she said.

The bench sat in silence.

Maya reached out. Her hand passed through the glass—through the window, through the boundary between cities—and touched the bench in the other Ashford. The wood was solid under her fingers. Cold. Real.

She pulled her hand back. Looked at her fingertips. Nothing. No residue. No proof.

But the bench was still there.

---

"This is insane."

Maya sat at her kitchen table, the sketchbook open in front of her. Four benches now. A coffee cup. A window. A doorway. She didn't remember drawing any of them.

She picked up her phone and searched for "parallel city" and "hallucinations" and "grief psychosis." The results were not helpful. The internet had opinions about everything and answers about nothing.

She closed her phone and looked at the sketchbook.

The coffee cup. She knew this cup. David had bought it for her on their first anniversary—the chipped handle, the faded logo, the way it fit perfectly in her hand. She'd lost it somewhere between the accident and now. She couldn't remember where.

But here it was. Sketched in her hand, in her studio, in a city that didn't exist.

Maya picked up the pencil.

The next line came automatically. Another coffee cup. Different angle. A different morning.

And then she was sketching more—doorways she recognized, windows that looked out on memories, a hospital room she'd never forgotten—

She stopped.

The sketchbook was full now. Every page. Sketches of things she recognized but couldn't remember drawing. A parallel city, rendered in pencil, spreading across the paper like a disease.

Maya looked out the window. The other Ashford was still there. The bench on Fifth and Main. The coffee cup in a window she recognized. The doorway that led somewhere she couldn't name.

She set the pencil down.

"What do buildings remember?" she whispered.

The parallel city didn't answer.

But the bench sat on its corner, waiting, as if it had been waiting for her all along.

---

### Chapter 5

The couch had never been comfortable, which was the point.

Dr. Foster's office was designed to be uncomfortable—the couch too firm, the chairs too straight, the light too bright. Maya had always appreciated that about it. Therapy wasn't supposed to be comfortable. Therapy was supposed to hurt.

"How are you doing?" Dr. Foster asked. She was a small woman with kind eyes and gray hair that suggested decades of listening to people's pain. Maya had been seeing her for six months now, ever since James had insisted, ever since the 2 AMs had become too frequent to ignore.

"Fine," Maya said automatically.

Dr. Foster waited.

Maya looked at the wall. There was a painting there—abstract, geometric, the kind of thing that was supposed to mean something but probably didn't. "I had a dream last night," she said.

"Tell me about it."

"I was sketching. And the things I was sketching... they were appearing. In the city. Outside my window." Maya heard how it sounded. Crazy. Unhinged. The kind of thing that got you sent to a different kind of doctor. "I know how it sounds."

"How does it sound?"

"Like I'm losing my mind."

Dr. Foster nodded slowly. "Or like you're processing something."

"It's not—" Maya stopped. Pressed her palms against her knees. The couch was firm, just firm enough to be uncomfortable. "It's like I can see something that isn't there. Or remember something that didn't happen."

"Can you tell me more?"

Maya thought about the bench on Fifth and Main. The coffee cup in the window. The parallel city that existed on the other side of her studio window. "I've been thinking about David," she said. "A lot. More than usual. It's like—" She struggled for words. "It's like he's closer than he was. Not in memory. In—" She gestured vaguely. "In some other way."

"The manifestation," Dr. Foster said quietly.

Maya looked at her. "I never told you about that."

"You mentioned it last week. The parallel city. The sketches that come to life." Dr. Foster's voice was gentle, neutral, the way it always was. "You framed it as a dream."

"Did I?"

"You did. And I didn't push, because you weren't ready to talk about it. But it sounds like something that's been on your mind."

Maya was quiet for a long moment. The painting on the wall stared back at her—geometric, meaningless, pretending to mean something.

"It feels real," she admitted. "The parallel city. When I'm sketching, when I'm in the studio, it feels like I'm not alone. Like they're—" She stopped. Swallowed. "Like they're somewhere I can reach."

"Them?"

"David. Lily." The names came out together, like they always did now. Linked in death as they'd been linked in life. "I know how it sounds."

"It sounds like you're grieving," Dr. Foster said. "And your mind is finding a way to hold onto the people you've lost."

"Is that healthy?"

"I don't know if it's healthy," Dr. Foster admitted. "But I know it's human. We find ways to keep the people we love close. Even when they're gone."

Maya thought about the bench on Fifth and Main. The coffee cup in the window. The parallel city that existed on the other side of her studio window.

"Do you think I'm avoiding something?" she asked.

"I think you're processing something," Dr. Foster corrected. "The question is whether the processing is helping you move forward or keeping you stuck in the past."

Maya looked at the painting on the wall. Geometric. Meaningless. "I don't know the answer."

"That's okay." Dr. Foster leaned forward slightly. "You don't have to know the answer right now. You just have to keep asking the question."

Maya left the session more conflicted than when she'd arrived.

---

### Chapter 6

She started with the small things.

The park bench came first—easy, familiar, the kind of memory that surfaced without effort. Maya sat at her drafting table in the studio and let the pencil move, letting the memory guide her hand. She remembered the way David had laughed when she spilled coffee on her shirt. She remembered the way the sun had caught his hair, turning it almost gold. She remembered thinking, *this is it. This is the person I want to spend my life with.*

The bench appeared in the parallel city. Perfect detail. Every slat, every leg, every chip in the paint.

She moved on to the coffee cup. The one from their first anniversary. The one with the chipped handle. The one she'd lost somewhere between the accident and now. She sketched it from memory—the shape, the faded logo, the particular way the handle curved—and it appeared in the parallel city, sitting on a windowsill she recognized from their first apartment.

Each manifestation brought a flood of memory. The park led to the coffee led to the apartment led to the hospital led to Lily's room at St. Catherine's. Maya sketched building after building, memory after memory, and the parallel city grew more detailed with each line.

She didn't sleep. She didn't eat. She didn't answer James's texts or Dr. Foster's reminders or Margaret's increasingly worried voicemails. She just sketched, hour after hour, filling page after page, bringing her family closer with every line.

The parallel city became real.

Maya walked through it in the early morning light, her footsteps echoing on streets that didn't exist. The bench was there—the first bench, the one from their first date. The coffee cup sat on its windowsill, waiting. The hospital rose in the distance, solid and real, and inside—

Inside, Maya found Lily's room.

The drawings were still on the walls. The crayon dinosaurs, the stick figures with too-long arms, the buildings that looked almost like the buildings Maya designed, seven-year-old approximations of architectural ambition. Lily's room, frozen in time, waiting for a seven-year-old girl who would never come home.

Maya stood in the doorway and cried.

She didn't know how long she stood there. Time moved differently in the parallel city. Minutes stretched into hours, hours collapsed into moments. She just stood and cried and looked at her daughter's drawings on walls that existed only because she remembered them.

When she finally left, the sun was setting over the parallel city.

Maya sat at her drafting table and kept sketching.

---

### Chapter 7

The proposal had been in spring.

Maya remembered that much. The restaurant had been small—too small, really, for a proposal, but David had always been bad at following plans. He'd been nervous, she remembered that too. His hands had shaken when he reached into his pocket. He'd dropped the ring twice before he managed to get it on her finger.

She sketched the restaurant now, in her studio, in the early hours of the morning when sleep was a stranger and the parallel city was the only place she felt alive. The building appeared in the parallel city—the small facade, the window where they'd sat, the awning that had been striped red and white and faded from years of sun.

The memory flooded back. The way David had looked at her. The way he'd said her name—*Maya*—like it was the only word he knew. The way the ring had caught the candlelight.

She sketched the hospital next. Not the one where Lily had been born—that memory was too painful, too raw—but the one where David had stayed for three days with pneumonia, back when they were still young and foolish and thought that love could protect you from everything. She sketched the room, the window, the view of the parking lot that David had complained about for three days straight.

She sketched her childhood home. The house she'd grown up in, the one with the creaky stair and the backyard that stretched all the way to the creek. She sketched the front porch, the door with the brass knob, the window in her old room where she'd spent so many nights staring at the ceiling, wondering who she was going to be.

But when she tried to remember who had lived in that house—

Nothing.

The memory was gone.

Maya stared at the sketch. The house was there, perfect detail, every board and window and door exactly as she remembered it. But the people who had lived there—the faces, the names, the voices—they were gone.

She tried to remember. Her parents, surely. Maybe a pet, a dog or a cat she couldn't name. But the faces wouldn't come. The names wouldn't come. The voices had faded to silence.

She flipped back through the sketchbook. The park bench. The coffee cup. The restaurant. The hospital. Her childhood home.

She tried to remember her parents' names.

Nothing.

Maya closed the sketchbook.

Her hands were shaking. The slight tremor she'd noticed weeks ago had become a constant tremble, a vibration that wouldn't stop. She looked at the parallel city through her studio window. It was beautiful in the way that memory was beautiful—perfect, preserved, frozen in a moment that had already passed.

But the more she added to it, the more she was losing.

She looked at the sketchbook. At the memories she'd traded for buildings. At the parallel city that was becoming more real than the original.

She didn't know what she was doing anymore.

She didn't know if she was saving herself or destroying herself.

She just knew she couldn't stop.

---

### Chapter 8

She had been so sure.

The collaborative building—the one she'd designed with David, the one that had been their only truly joint project, the one that had taken six months of late nights and arguments and compromises and had emerged as something neither of them could have created alone. Maya had been so sure she could remember it.

But when she sketched the building in the parallel city, it appeared wrong.

The proportions were off. The facade didn't match her memory. The entrance was on the wrong side, the windows were the wrong shape, the whole building looked like a photograph of a building, a copy of a copy, something that had lost its essence in the translation.

And David—

Maya found him in the parallel city, standing in front of the wrong building, looking at her with eyes that didn't recognize her.

"Do I know you?" he asked.

His voice was David's voice. The cadence, the warmth, the slight rasp he'd gotten from years of talking too much. But the look in his eyes was wrong. Curious but distant. Friendly but unfamiliar.

"It's me," Maya said. "David, it's me. It's Maya."

"Maya." He repeated the name like he was tasting it. "That sounds... familiar."

"It should be. We're—" She stopped. What were they? Husband and wife? That had been true. Was it still true if he didn't remember? "We were married. Twelve years. We have—" Had. Had what? A daughter? A life? A house full of memories now buried under dust? "We had a daughter."

Something flickered in David's eyes. A shadow of recognition. "A daughter?"

"Lily. She's—" Maya stopped. The parallel city had Lily, somewhere. She was there, Maya could feel her, but she couldn't find her. "She's here. I can find her."

But David was already turning away, already walking toward the wrong building, already becoming a stranger with David's face.

"Wait," Maya said. "Please. I just need to—"

But he was gone.

---

She tried to remember her wedding day.

The venue—she could see it, the church with the tall windows and the worn wooden floors. The flowers—roses, she'd chosen roses, white and yellow and something else, something she couldn't quite— The dress—white, simple, the one her mother had approved of—her mother—

Who was her mother?

Maya sat in her studio and tried to remember.

The venue. The flowers. The dress.

Her mother's face. Her mother's name. Her mother's voice.

Nothing.

She tried to remember the vows. The kiss. The moment when David had lifted her veil and looked at her like she was the only person in the world.

Nothing.

She tried to remember the reception. The cake. The first dance.

Nothing.

The wedding day was gone. Traded for a building she couldn't quite remember, for a husband who no longer knew her name.

Maya opened her mouth to scream.

No sound came out.

---

## Part One Complete

Maya stared at the incomplete building in the parallel city and understood, finally, what she had been doing.

She had been paying with herself.

Every sketch, every manifestation, every building she'd added to the parallel city—it had all cost her something. A memory here, a detail there, a face or a name or a voice, traded one by one for the privilege of seeing David and Lily again.

But they weren't David and Lily anymore. They were echoes. Copies. Strangers wearing the faces of the people she'd loved.

And she was disappearing.

The woman who had designed Meridian Tower. The architect who had built her name into the skyline. The wife and mother who had lost everything and tried to rebuild it in a city that didn't exist.

She was fading.

And she didn't know if there was enough of her left to save.

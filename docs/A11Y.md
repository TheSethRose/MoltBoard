# Accessibility Audit — Focus, Labels, Contrast

Date: 2026-01-27
Scope: MoltBoard dashboard UI (Tasks/Kanban, Projects, Dialogs)
Standard: WCAG 2.1 AA

## Summary

- **Focus handling**: Mostly good. Buttons/inputs use `focus-visible` styles via Tailwind and shadcn components. Dialogs are Radix-based (focus trap + focus restore).
- **Labels**: Most icon-only buttons already include `aria-label`. Inputs and selects use visible labels or `aria-label`.
- **Contrast**: Relies heavily on `text-muted-foreground` and colored chips. Needs spot-checks with a contrast checker; some combinations may fall below 4.5:1 depending on theme.

## Quick Pass Findings

### ✅ Focus

- Radix `Dialog` components provide focus trap and restore (good).
- Form controls in `tasks-client.tsx` include `focus-visible` ring styles.
- `KanbanBoard` uses `focus-visible` on cards and controls.

### ✅ Labels

- Icon buttons often include `aria-label` (e.g., delete, copy task details, project path copy).
- Form inputs and selects include labels or `aria-label` attributes.

### ⚠️ Contrast (needs verification)

- `text-muted-foreground` on `bg-card`/`bg-background` may fail in some themes.
- Tag chips and status pills should be checked for 4.5:1 contrast (normal text) or 3:1 (large text).
- Focus rings should maintain 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors.

## Recommended Follow-ups

1. Run **axe DevTools** or Lighthouse Accessibility audit on the Tasks page and Project detail page.
2. Validate contrast for:
   - `text-muted-foreground` on `bg-card`/`bg-background`
   - Tag chip text on colored backgrounds
   - Status pill text colors
3. Verify keyboard-only navigation across:
   - Kanban columns (drag targets, card focus)
   - Modal forms (Add/Edit Task)
   - Project settings dialogs

## Files Reviewed

- `src/app/(dashboard)/tasks/tasks-client.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/kanban-board.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/project-detail-client.tsx`
- `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`

Notes: This is a code-level audit. A browser-based audit (axe/Lighthouse) is recommended to confirm contrast and focus order across themes.
